Methods used in the article _Assessment of single cell RNA-seq statistical methods on microbiome data_.

Here we present several aspects of the microbiome data analysis, evaluating:
<ul>
  <li> the Goodness Of Fit (GOF) between real data and the distributional assumptions of some differential abundance detection methods; </li>
  <li> the ability of differential abundance detection methods to control the Type I Error; </li>
  <li> the ability of differential abundance detection methods in terms of Consistency and Replicability; </li>
  <li> the Power of differential abundance detection methods in a framework of parametric simulations. </ul>

Data in `HMP16SData` and `curatedMetagenomicData` Bioconductor packages, respectively for 16S and WMS, are the microbiome data used in this analysis.

## Goodness of Fit (GOF) evaluation
The directory _./goodness_of_fit/_ contains the _GOF.Rmd_ file which loads microbiome data, estimates several parametric models on the real datasets and evaluates the goodness of fit for each dataset. 

## Type I Error Control
The directory _./type_I_error_control/_ contains the _TIEC.Rmd_ file which loads the same biological samples from the Human Microbiome Project (stool) for both 16S and WMS. Then, mock datasets, without differentially abundant features, are generated in order to compare differential abundance detection between methods.

## Replicability and Consistencty
The directory _./consistency_replicability/_ contains the _consistency_replicability.Rmd_ file which evaluates Concordance At the Top (CAT) between methods (consistency) and within method (replicability) in 6 real datasets.

## Power
The directory _./power/_ contains several files:
<ul>
  <li> datasets_and_models.R which estimates the Negative Binomial and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial parametric distributions to use as template for the simulations in 6 datasets; </li>
  <li> simulator.R which creates the simulation framework; </li>
  <li> eval_function_call.R which tests the differential abundance detection methods. This RScript was launched in the cluster using the SLURM workload manager; </li>
  <li> evalPVals.R which computes specificity, sensitivity and other measures considering p-values generated by each method in the simulations;</li>
  <li> plot_eval.R which puts the information from all datasets together and then plots the results.</li>
</ul>

## Data
Since the entire data production took a long time, the _./data/_ directory contains several outputs from all the analyses. This should make it easier for the user to replicate the results.

## Instructions and R environment
To replicate the analyses it is strongly suggested to clone or download the entire github directory. Some of the functions used this paper are adapted from the work of: _A broken promise: microbiome differential abundance methods do not control the false discovery rate._, their original code is available at https://users.ugent.be/~shawinke/ABrokenPromise/index.html. The analyses run in many version of R during the development, R 3.5.1 was the final R version on which the methods worked. However it is fundamental to use specific versions for some CRAN or Bioconductor packages:
<ul>
  <li> flexmix v2.3-13 and scde 1.99.1 which can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/flexmix/
and https://github.com/hms-dbmi/scde/releases</li>
  <li> Seurat v2.3.4 which can be found at https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/releases</li>
</ul>
